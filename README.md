# When-Pigs-Fly-Animation
<p>This is a simple animation I made for the Codepen challenge "Fly." I'm a novice at animation, but I thought a flying pig might be a unique spin on the challenge, so I decided to give it a go. I used <a href="https://albertwalicki.com/blog/unique-weather-app-images#excercise-no.1---first-ever-css-cloud">this tutorial</a> to help me figure out how to build the clouds. I took the pig from SVG Repo since I found one I was happy with and it saved me the time to attempt making one in CSS myself. I also looked at Kristian Ekfors's code in their <a href="https://codepen.io/Ekfors/pen/wvyPGgb">"Be Fly" Codepen</a> to help me figure out how to animate the movement for the clouds and the pig.</p>
<p>You can view this animation on my Codepen account <a href="https://codepen.io/TurtleQueenCoding/pen/vYdWVRz">here</a>.</p>
